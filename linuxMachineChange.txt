Free from worries and cares,
I work on my new linux vm
With dubstep playing in spotify
And Dan replacing the TV with
A christmas tree.
Wheee!  We are free!

Oh yeah!

F*** yeah! Finally vi is fixed!

Yeah it seems to be.  Glad I did 'sudo apt-get install vim'

Now I just need to get my diff tool working!  Which I am doing now!
